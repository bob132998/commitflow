## ✨ Features

### 🔧 Project Management

A beautiful, AI-assisted workspace for managing your projects and tasks:

- 🗂 **Kanban Board** – Organize tasks visually using drag-and-drop.  
  Each task card shows **priority color accents**, **assignee avatars**, and **due dates**.
- 📋 **List View** – See all tasks in a clean table layout; click any row to open task details.
- 📆 **Timeline View** – A Gantt-style horizontal timeline to visualize progress and overlaps between tasks.
- 💬 **Task Details Modal** –
  - **Rich text editor** (React Quill) for descriptions
  - **File attachments** (via AWS S3 integration)
  - **Inline comments** with author, timestamp, and preview links
- 🎨 **Smart Selectors** –
  - Assignee and Priority fields powered by **React Select**, dynamically colored per user or priority level
- 🧍 **Team Management** –  
  Add or remove team members using modern UI components, with color-coded avatars automatically generated.
- 🧱 **Project Management Sidebar** –
  - Create or delete projects easily
  - Integrated **SweetAlert2** confirmations for safe deletions
  - **Toast notifications** (`react-toastify`) for success actions (e.g., project or member added)
- 🌙 **Dark/Light Mode Aware** –  
  Smooth color transitions and well-tuned contrast for both themes.

## 🚀 Setup with Docker

### 1. Copy the environment file

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Then fill in your configuration values:

```env
# Environment
NODE_ENV="development"

# Logger
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=
LOG_LEVEL=info

# PostgreSQL
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
POSTGRES_DB=commitflow
DB_PORT=5432

# pgAdmin
PGADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
PGADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
ADMIN_PORT=8080

# Prisma
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@db:5432/commitflow

# Backend
BE_PORT=8000
OPENAI_API_KEY=
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
API_KEY=""
JWT_SECRET=""

# GitHub Integration
GITHUB_OWNER=
GITHUB_TOKEN=

# Frontend
FE_PORT=3000
VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:8000"

# S3 Storage
S3_BUCKET_NAME=
S3_REGION=
S3_ACCESS_KEY=
S3_SECRET_KEY=
# S3 COMPATIBLE STORAGE
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=
```

> **Note:** Use `db` as the PostgreSQL host inside Docker (not `localhost`).

### 2. Build and start all containers

For production:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

For development (with hot reload and live updates):

```bash
./scripts/build.dev.sh
```

---

### 3. Verify running containers

```bash
docker ps
```

| Service  | URL                   |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000 |
| Backend  | http://localhost:8000 |
| pgAdmin  | http://localhost:8080 |

---

### 4. Access pgAdmin

- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `admin123`

Then add a new PostgreSQL server:

| Field    | Value      |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Host     | db         |
| Database | commitflow |
| User     | postgres   |
| Password | password   |

---

## 🧩 Prisma

If this is your first time running CommitFlow, run a Prisma database sync:

```bash
docker exec -it commitflow-api npx prisma db push
```

> The `scripts/build.sh` script automatically handles Prisma setup on first run.

---

## 🧠 Running the Application

**Development (hot reload):**

```bash
NODE_ENV="development"
```

**Production:**

```bash
NODE_ENV="production"
```

You can switch between development and production using different Docker Compose files.
